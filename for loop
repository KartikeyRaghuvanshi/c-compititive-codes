A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.


#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;


int main(){
int i,a,b;
cin>>a>>b;

string nums[11] = {"one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","even","odd"};

for (i=a; i<=b; i++){
    if (i>9 && i%2==0)
    {
        cout<<nums[9]<<endl;
    }
    else if (i>9 && i%2!=0)
    {
            cout<<nums[10]<<endl;
    }
    else{
        cout<<nums[i-1]<<endl;
    }
}
}
